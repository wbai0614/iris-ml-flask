Main tip/advice he gave me is leading from the bottom. Seniors are busy, and how you can lead and set everything up for them and be proactive reaching out. \"Leading from the bottom\". That shows inititive and helps you stand out. By thinking in his shoes, you are able to lead and make things easier for him by setting everything up. This shows leadership even when you are lower leveled."

Stress the importance of studying python, and gave us a book title \"Python for data analysis\" v2. By reading it several times and understanding it, would be extremely helpful. Also study SQL topics. But python more important because we use SQL to extract and do most of the work on python. Having good python can also help with other languages such as pyspark and hadoop and big data high level languages."
